# :guitar: Beyond basic strumming :mountain:

## :wave: Introduction

This guide introduces a few techniques to make your rhythm playing a bit more interesting. All techniques in this guide will concern your picking/strumming hand (i.e., your right hand, if you are a right-handed guitarist). 

There are multiple songs covered in this guide, all of which are modern guitar staples. Hopefully you will be familiar with at least one of them! All songs coveed will be played using standard open chords, which you should be familiar with by now. It's possible that slightly different chords are used on the actual tracks, but all sound perfectly good using simple open chords. 

> 📌 **Note:** * **Rhythm vs. Lead Guitar**: In a band setting, think of rhythm guitar as the "foundation" and lead guitar as the "decoration." The rhythm guitarist plays chords and strumming patterns that provide the song's backbone and keep everyone together, while the lead guitarist plays the memorable melodies, riffs, and solos that grab your attention. 


## :arrow_down: Rhythm using just downstrokes

Some guitarists choose to play rhythm parts using only downward strums (never upstrokes) to achieve a heavier, more aggressive sound with stronger attack and emphasis. This technique is common in punk rock, metal, and some folk styles because downstrokes naturally produce more volume and "chunk" than upstrokes. The trade-off is that it's more physically demanding and limits you to slower tempos, but it creates a distinctive powerful feel that alternating up/down strumming can't match.

A famous song that just uses downstrokes for the main rhythm part is [With or Without You](https://youtube.com/shorts/q2l_Uhv_Ssc?si=5tEOzEHVkJnrgLBm), by U2. This is neither heavy nor aggressive, but if you try and play it using a mixture of up and downstrokes, you'll quickly see it has a very different feel! Consistent use of downstrokes gives this rhythm a steady, almost hypotic quality. The chords used are:


<img width="547" height="177" alt="u2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93ce140c-6bac-485f-b16e-a770c4d08e5f" />


> 📌 **Note:** To play this song in the same key as the original (`DMajor`), you'll need a capo, placed on the second fret. For this lesson we'll ignore the capo and just play the song in a different key (`CMajor`). It will still sound good (as long as you don't try and play along to the recording!)


When getting to grips with thing song, you should practice playing each chord with **straight and even** downstrokes. This means every chord will be played 8 downstrokes, spaced evenly in time, and using (roughly) the same amount of **attack** for each strum. 

This is an example of an **8th note** rhythm. Imagine playing whilst also saying "One (and) two (and) three (and) four (and)" in an even cadence. To hear an 8th note rhythm in action, watch [this video](https://youtube.com/shorts/mjP3SOZ0jqQ?si=JsBvENKb98NQ1gk3). The 8th note rhythm is demonstrated at around the 10 second mark. 

> 💡 **Tip:** *Attack* refers to how forcefully and precisely you strike the strings when beginning a strum or pick. A "hard attack" means striking the strings with more force, creating a sharper, more aggressive sound with pronounced initial transient. A "soft attack" involves gentler contact, producing a mellower, smoother tone. The attack affects both the volume and character of the sound - harder attacks emphasise the percussive "snap" of the pick hitting the strings, while softer attacks blend the notes together more smoothly.

If you listen closely to the acoustic version of this song (linked above), you'll notice that the guitarist is slightly emphasising the 3rd downstroke within every chord, using a slightly harder attack. This is an **accented downstroke** — not a different strumming direction, just a stronger hit that makes that beat stand out. Once you've mastered playing the rhythm with a straight and even 8th note rhythm, try adding in this accent to make things sound more interesting.

The accent appears again on the 7th strum within the chord (each chord is strummed 8 times as part of this 8th note rhythm, remember). If you're struggling to find where to place the emphasis, think back to "One (and) two (and) three (and) four (and)". The emphasis appears at **two** and **four**. Putting it together, we have:

"One (and) **two** (and) three (and) **four** (and)".


## :palm_tree: Palm muting :mute:

Palm muting is a technique where you rest the side of your picking hand (palm) lightly on the strings near the bridge while strumming or picking. This creates a muffled, percussive "chunk" sound by dampening the strings' vibrations. The strings still produce notes, but they sound much shorter and less resonant than normal. 

Palm muting is commonly used in rock, punk, and metal to create rhythmic emphasis and add texture to chord progressions. The key is using just enough palm contact to muffle the sound without completely stopping the strings from ringing. A quick palm muting tutorial video is available [here](https://youtube.com/shorts/NIthJ95fEAI?si=km8eYlSYAso8XSph)

To practice this technique, we will stick with *With or Without You* by U2. Palm muting works particularly well for rhythm parts made up entirely of downstrokes. 


## :arrow_down: Rhythm using downstrokes and upstrokes :arrow_up:

Let's now look at rhythm parts consisting of downstrokes and upstrokes. 

Downstrokes usually sound heavier, fuller, and more percussive, while upstrokes come across lighter and brighter, often used to emphasise the off-beats and give the rhythm a bounce or swing. Mixing both creates texture and dynamic range in your strumming. Keeping your hand in a constant down-up cycle also helps maintain consistency, since it prevents stiffness, keeps your timing solid, and avoids wasted motion. If you relied only on downstrokes, you’d struggle to play faster patterns smoothly, and your rhythm would sound rigid rather than flowing.

To practice playing rhythm parts with a combination of upstrokes and downstrokes, we will look at the intro of **Time of Your Life (Good Riddance)** by Green Day. We will be using a simplified tab which relies on simple strumming, not arpeggiated chords (which are covered in a subsequent section). A recording of this simplified version can be heard [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg_nXKjLLCY&list=RDrg_nXKjLLCY&start_radio=1), and the chords for the intro are as follows:

<img width="322" height="156" alt="greendat" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03e7876c-7840-4c1b-b34f-b78d640d6082" />


> 📌 **Note:** This is the first time we've encountered an `add9` chord. `Cadd9` is very easy to play when moving from `GMajor`, you just need to movefor first and second fingers down by one string, leaving your 4th and 5th fingers in the same position

The basic strumming pattern is:

:arrow_down::arrow_down::arrow_up:, :arrow_up: :arrow_down: :arrow_up:

Note the comma in the above, indicating a short pause. 

This sequence is played twice for `GMajor`, then you move to `Cadd9` and play it once, then move to `DMajor` and play it once, before cycling back round to the start

Downstrokes often land on the strong beats, whilst upstrokes naturally fall between them. Going back to our earlier strategy for representing rhythm patterns ("one and two and three and..."), downstrokes often fall on the numbers, whereas upstrokes naturally fall between them (the “ands”). **This is not a rule, it's just commonly seen!**

> 💡 **Tip:** Rock and punk typically lean more on downstrokes for drive and power, but still rely on upstrokes for smoothness and speed.Reggae, funk, and ska, on the other hand, often emphasize upstrokes, giving them their characteristic “choppy” off-beat feel. An example of ska playing with strong upstroke emphasis can be heard [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd7wdmi6mSo&t=100s). 


## :notes: Arpeggios


An **arpeggio** is a type of chord in which the notes that compose a chord are individually sounded in a progressive rising or descending order, rather than strumming all the strings together. Think of it as "breaking apart" a chord - you're playing the same notes, just separately and in sequence.

Your fretting hand will make the chord shapes as normal, but your right hand will individually pick the relevant notes. 


To learn arpeggios we will look at the song [Hurt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AHCfZTRGiI&list=RD8AHCfZTRGiI&start_radio=1) - originally by Nine Inch Nails, but popularised by Johnny Cash.

The chords for the intro and verse of this song are:

<img width="365" height="177" alt="hurt" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fac16fab-3a4f-4817-9e86-6234550ae3b3" />


As we are arpeggiating the chords (and so need to know which chord notes we're picking, and in which order), we need to move to guitar tab:


<img width="600" height="200" alt="hurt_tab" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/000a86e1-9cab-4bba-8673-a936143eeb90" />

So we start the `Am` part of the song by first playing the open 5th string on its own, then quickly moving to the 2nd fret 4th string, before finishing with strumming the first 3 notes of the `Am` chord together. A similar pattern is then followed for `Cmaj` and `Dmaj`, before cycling back round. As a result, this song is actually a mixture of arpeggios and normal chord strums. 


> 📌 **Note:** The `Am` arpeggio starts on the 5th string open, which is an `A` note. The `Cmaj` arpeggio starts on the 3rd fret 5th string, which is a `C` note. The `Dmaj` arpeggio starts on the open string of the 4th fret, which is (you guessed it) a `D` note. It's not a rule that arpeggiated chords must start on the chord root note, but often this is the case.


> 💡 **Tip:** When starting out, don't worry if you hit more strings than the tab specifies for the chord strums - if you've fretted the chord properly, it will still sound very similar to the recording. If you're struggling to mix arpeggios and chord strums together, start practicing this song by just playing 3 note arpeggios for each chord. For both `Am` and `Cmaj` you would play strings 5, 4 and three in sequence, and for `Dmaj`, you would play strings 4, 3 and 2. 


## :twisted_rightwards_arrows: Arpeggiated strumming

Arpeggiated strumming a hybrid technique, combining elements of both strumming and arpeggios. Instead of strumming all the strings at once or picking individual notes in a strict sequence (as in a true arpeggio), you strum the strings in a way that emphasizes individual notes within the chord. This creates a flowing, broken-chord effect where the notes are heard more distinctly than in a typical strum.

The classic example of this technique is [House of the Rising Sun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4bFqW_eu2I&list=RDN4bFqW_eu2I&start_radio=1) by The Animals

The tab for the intro is as follows:

<img width="607" height="343" alt="hotrs_tab" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4fc2c668-6900-4712-8ace-8049364c5d65" />


> 📌 **Note:** This tab shows the associated chords above each bar. As with Hurt, this song starts with the open 5th string (`A` note), before performing an arpeggiated strum through the notes of `Am`. Also like Hurt (and many other examples of arpeggiation), we start each arpeggio by first playing the root note

> 📌 **Note:** When playing the `Am` arpeggio, we don't play the `E` note on the 2nd fret 4th string. There's no good reason to play this arpeggio without fretting the full `Am` chord though - we just need to be careful not to hit this `E` string to sound truly authentic. 


## :drum: Percussive strumming

Percussive strumming involves using your strumming hand to create a rhythmic, drum-like sound whilst you play. Instead of just playing notes, you add a "chka" or "thump" sound, making your playing more rhythmic and lively. This is done by either brushing the strings with the side of your hand, or by muting the strings with your palm while strumming, so you hear a click or thud instead of a clear note. Here's a [very detailed guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP292DdVOKs) on the technique. 

A beginner friendly song that can be enhanced with percussive strumming is [Polly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzE1QIAAWIc&list=RDXzE1QIAAWIc&start_radio=1) by Nirvana. The chords are demonstrated in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/4fhYk-zsG_4). Pay close attention to the guitarist's strumming hand. Notice how they add in a percussive strum after the `Em` and `Gmaj` chords
