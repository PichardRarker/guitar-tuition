# :roller_coaster: String slides and bends :bowing_man:

## :wave: Introduction

This guide concerns two fundamental guitar techniques: guitar slides and bends.

Both techniques involve smoothly changing the pitch of a note without re-picking the string. They both add vocal-like qualities and emotion to guitar playing.


## :book: Terminology

* **String bending**: technique where the player pushes or (less commonly) pulls a string to raise its pitch. The push/pull is done in the up/down axis (i.e., up towards the ceiling or down towards the floor), without moving to a different fret. The amount of bend determines how much the pitch changes. Commonly, players will pick a string once, then execute one (or multiple) bends, creating a **legato** sound
* **Releasing a bend**: returning a note back to its original pitch after bending (so essentially the the opposite of the initial bend motion)
* **String slide**: where the player picks a note and then moves the fretting finger up or down the neck to a different fret without lifting it off the string. This creates a smooth, continuous change in pitch and a connected, legato sound. As you might expect, short slides have a different "feel" to long slides.
* **Legato**:  musical term meaning "smooth and connected." On guitar, legato refers to playing notes in a way that they flow together without noticeable breaks, often using techniques like slides, bends, hammer-ons, and pull-offs instead of picking each note individually. Hammer-ons and pull-offs are discussed in a separate guide.
* **Glissando**: a musical term for a continuous slide upward or downward between two notes. On guitar, a glissando is typically performed by sliding the fretting finger along the string from one fret to another, creating a smooth transition in pitch. Both string slides and certain types of bends can produce a glissando effect, as they allow the pitch to change seamlessly without re-picking the string.
* **Full tone bend**: where the player pushes or pulls a string so that its pitch rises by two semitones (one whole step). For example, bending a note at the 7th fret so it sounds like the note at the 9th fret. This is a common expressive technique in many styles of guitar music.
* **Semi tone bend**: where the player bends a string so its pitch rises by one semitone (half step). For example, bending a note at the 7th fret so it sounds like the note at the 8th fret. Compared to full tone bends, semi tone bends are less common in rock, blues and pop solos (but still definitely worth mastering)

> ‚ùì**Glissando and legato sound quite similar..** - Don't worry about this for now. The key differences between these terms will be cleared up in a subsequent guide. 


## :musical_note: Notation

### :smiley: String sliding notation is straightforward

In guitar tablature, slides are typically notated using the symbols `/` for sliding up and `\` for sliding down between notes.

This notation shows a slide _up_ from the 5th fret to the 7th fret on the 6th string (picking only the 5th string note):


<img width="350" height="100" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57f497f3-1b8e-4d54-8469-74d37c7af8a6" />

Same thing, rendered as simple text:

<img width="250" height="239" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07ba0abd-a4f8-435c-83e8-051838cf08c8" />

And here's notation for a slide _down_ from the 7th fret to the 5th fret on the 6th string:

<img width="300" height="125" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8fad5b9-d863-492b-a2ae-53ea6a9ad5a5" />


### :confused: String bending notation is a bit more complex...

There are different strategies for representing string bending on paper. One apprach is to write down the starting note (the note that's picked), then add the note that we're bend up to in brackets alongside:

<img width="250" height="125" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3ebeb0f-eba2-49d0-a051-ea9c2ec0ecc5" />

.. So above the tab instructs us to pick the note on the 3rd string of the 7th fret, then bend the note until the pitch matches the note on the 8th fret (same string). To describe this in musical notes, we're starting by picking a `D` note (7th fret, 3rd string, assuming standard tuning), then bending the string to elevate the pitch to a `D#` (the same note as playing 3rd string 8th fret). The above tab also includes the superscript **BU** label (_bend up_), but some tabs may not include this.


> üí° **Tip:** The above bend represents a change in pitch of one semitone (`D` to `D#`, so it's a **semi tone bend**


Sometimes arrows are used to represent bending:

<img width="350" height="100" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1d33fbb-4028-45d4-8098-de28dc779951" />

Reading left to right, once again we're starting by plucking the `D` note (7th fret, first string). The first bend represents a **full tone bend**, which would be `D` to `E` (jumping over the `D#` inbetween). The `full` label above the string bend tells us how much we're bending the string by. For the next bend (once again starting with the `D` on the 3rd string) we're only bending up a **semi tone** to `D#` (as indicated by the `1/2` label)

> üí° **Tip:** If we were representing the full tone bend using the previous notation method, it would look something like this: `----7----(9)`, as the 9th fret on the 3rd string is an `E` note


Using simple text notation:

<img width="173" height="163" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4582de1-784b-49b7-8183-562cf8720f70" />

... the above represents a bend up from the note of the 5th fret 3rd string (`C`) to the note we'd get if we played the same string on the 7th fret (`D`), followed by a _release_ back down to the original pitch (`C`). 

## :hammer_and_wrench: Technique: bending (single string)

Trying to comprehensively teach string bending over text is a fool's errand. Check out this [great guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yQLHM5H10c) from `MartyMusic`.


### :thinking: String pushing/pulling, or palm rotation?

The previous video shows string bending as a push/pull action of the fingers. There is another school of thought that proposes that bends should instead be driven by rotation of the palm. This approach is covered (in detail) in  [this guide ](https://youtu.be/fgDY8k0Gjzc?si=5eelEkprmmQxU9gS) from the excellent `JustinGuitar` YouTube channel. 

This rotation-based approach has your thumb wrapped around the neck of the guitar, sometimes referred to as "the blues position". The finger push-pull technique, on the other hand, often has the pad of the thumb pushed into the back of the neck (the "classical position"). A clear visualisation on these 2 different hand positions (in the context of string bending) can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtoK5YsQ_uU&t=128s).

I personally think the palm rotation approach is not particularly beginner-friendly. Many people sing the praises of this approach compared to finger pushing/pulling (the last video, for example). My advice would be to start with the finger push/pull approach, and move on to the blues position-based approach when you're more comfortable, or if after a few hours of practice you're constently struggling with bending strings principally through the movement of the fingers.


### :rage: How do I stop accidentally catching other strings when executing a bend? 

When starting out, it's very common to accidentally hit other strings when executing a bend. As you bend the string up a full note, your fingers end up knocking into the string directly above the string you're bending (let's say you're bending 9th fret 2nd string, you're going to collide with the open 3rd string). As you *release* the bend, returning the 2nd string to the original pitch, you catch the 3rd string, making it ring out. Below are some tips for avoiding this situaton. It will help to see these technique suggestions in action, so make sure to watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnHS5BRn5Hg) after reading:

* If you've followed along with the previous videos in this section, then you should be executing string bends with your third finger, with fingers 1 and 2 also on the string for added support. Try slightly raising up (away from the floor, towards your face) your first finger, so that when you execute the bend, you end up gently pressing against the above string. When you release the bend, your first finger will still be pressed lightly against the above string (at least for the start of the release process), preventing it ringing out.
* Try and avoid playing string bends with your fingertips. In other words, angle your fingers slightly when fretting the notes and carrying out bends, rather than playing with your fingers completely perpendicular to the fretboard. This "flattend fingers" position is easier to adopt if you're holding the fretboard in the "blues position".
* Use the side of the thumb to mute the string above the string you're bending, getting it into position shortly after you've picked the note and executed the bend (the unwanted noise typically only starts when you begin releasing the bend, so you have a bit of time to prepare). It's also a good idea to lightly rest your palm against strings 6, 5 and maybe 4, just in case you accidentally hit these when bending (chances are if you're looking at string bending, you're looking at strings 1, 2 and 3). I personally don't use this technique, but some do. 

## :hammer_and_wrench: Technique: sliding (single string)

Pick a string and decide on a starting note. Fret the note, then pick the string so the note rings out clearly. Without lifting your finger, push or pull your finger up or down the neck to your target fret (for example, from the 5th fret to the 7th fret). Maintain finger pressure as you move, so the sound stays connected. Once you reach the target fret, let the note ring out.

Begin with short slides (like fret 5 ‚Üí fret 7). Once comfortable, try longer ones (like fret 3 ‚Üí fret 10) for a more dramatic effect.

## :muscle: Exercise: practicing string bends and slides together

Recall from the beginning of this guide that both bending and sliding are techniques for changing the pitch of a note without re-picking the string. String bends are tricky at first, as you need to develop and intuitive "feel" for how far to bend the string up/down to achieve the appropriate change in pitch (full tone, semi tone, or even two tone if you're feeling incredibly brave). String slides, on the other hand, are a bit more straightforward (as long as you start in one fret and end up in another fret, your notes will sound good!). 

It's a good idea to practice both string bending and sliding at the same time. The main benefit of this is that you can use the string sliding exercise to judge whether or not you are applying the correct amount of pressure when executing a bend. 

First, execute a string slide on the 3rd string of the 5th fret. In one single slide (picking the string only once), slide up to the 7th fret, then back down to the 5th fret


<img width="224" height="164" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07c5bb64-3b58-4c93-a7bf-032e86f01620" />


After doing this, perform a string bend and release, also on the 5th fret 3rd string, and also targeting the pitch of the 7th fret 3rd string:

<img width="168" height="159" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/639a72ca-30e3-44a3-8a74-15802575698d" />


**Why practice these together?** if executed correctly, the bend should sound quite similar to the slide. For both of these executions, the middle note in the sequence should be a `D`. If the string bend sounds a bit off, it's probably because you're bending too far/not bending enough. Practicing bends alongside an equivalent slide up/down can help you master the ability to bend strings the correct amount.


> üí° **Tip:** The amount of force you need to exert to achieve the correct change in pitch when bending a string will change subtly between guitars. This is due to differing string tensions, arising from different gauges of string, or possibly due to differences in how the two guitars are set up. If you jump between different guitars, expect to have to subtly re-calibrate your string bend-ometer.

## :notes: Practice song: Smells Like Teen Spirit, by Nirvana

The guitar solo to Smells Like Teen Spirit is a great beginner-friendly solo, including both string bends and slides. The full song tab can be found [here](https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/nirvana/smells-like-teen-spirit-tabs-202727)

## :rocket: Advanced: strings and bends involving multiple strings

So far we've only covered bends and slides on single strings. Both techniques can be done in a slightly more complicated fashion, involving multiple strings:

### Double-stop bends

This technique involves bending a string up a full tone or semi tone, _and also bending up the string directly above or below to the same degree_:


<img width="244" height="156" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a19f47a5-8127-4a4a-a486-c7d248dd8a7a" />

Here we see both the 2nd and 3rd strings on the 9th fret bending up a semi tone, before being released back down to the original pitch. You can apply pressure to the 2 strings by fretting them each individually with 2 separate fingers, or by using the _barring_ technique (as covered in the power chords guide) to fret both notes with a single finger. Be warned: these bends require some extra strength!

### Double-stop slides

You can probably guess what this is - a technique where you slide two or more notes at the same time:

<img width="177" height="121" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a352940c-7fa3-4ba0-be3c-bce8f3a90cf7" />

### Unison bends

This bending technique involves 2 strings, _but only one of the strings undergoes bending_. Unison bending is a guitar technique where you bend one string so that its pitch matches the pitch of another string played simultaneously. Unlike a regular multi-string bend, where each string bends to a different target note (creating a harmony), a unison bend is all about making two notes converge to the same pitch:

<img width="500" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6e87ca4-f492-4a72-b5aa-29d4f8c5c423" />

In the above tab, notice how the bend notation is only directed at the note on the 2nd string. In other words, the note on the first string is played, but no bending occurs. For each of the 6 examples, the bend on the second string will produce the same note as is played on the first string. For example, in the first part of the tab, the 2nd string 8th fret and 1st string 5th fret are strummed together, playing `G` (2nd string) and `A` (first string). By bending the 2nd string up a full tone, we then get a second `A`!

Examples of unison bends can be seen [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtOBJtMuE80)
