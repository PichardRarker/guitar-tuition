# :roller_coaster: String slides and bends :bowing_man:

## :wave: Introduction

This guide concerns two fundamental guitar techniques: guitar slides and bends.

Both techniques involve smoothly changing the pitch of a note without re-picking the string. They both add vocal-like qualities and emotion to guitar playing.


## :book: Terminology

* **String bending**: technique where the player pushes or (less commonly) pulls a string to raise its pitch. The push/pull is done in the up/down axis (i.e., towards the ceiling or towards the floor), without moving to a different fret. The amount of bend determines how much the pitch changes. Commonly, players will pick a string once, then execute one (or multiple) bends, creating a **legato** sound
* **String slide**: where the player picks a note and then moves the fretting finger up or down the neck to a different fret without lifting it off the string. This creates a smooth, continuous change in pitch and a connected, legato sound. As you might expect, short slides have a different "feel" to long slides.
* **Legato**:  musical term meaning "smooth and connected." On guitar, legato refers to playing notes in a way that they flow together without noticeable breaks, often using techniques like slides, bends, hammer-ons, and pull-offs instead of picking each note individually. Hammer-ons and pull-offs are discussed in a separate guide.
* **Glissando**: a musical term for a continuous slide upward or downward between two notes. On guitar, a glissando is typically performed by sliding the fretting finger along the string from one fret to another, creating a smooth transition in pitch. Both string slides and certain types of bends can produce a glissando effect, as they allow the pitch to change seamlessly without re-picking the string.
* **Full tone bend**: where the player pushes or pulls a string so that its pitch rises by two semitones (one whole step). For example, bending a note at the 7th fret so it sounds like the note at the 9th fret. This is a common expressive technique in many styles of guitar music.
* **Semi tone bend**: where the player bends a string so its pitch rises by one semitone (half step). For example, bending a note at the 7th fret so it sounds like the note at the 8th fret. Compared to full tone bends, semi tone bends are less common in rock, blues and pop solos (but still definitely worth mastering)

## :musical_note: Notation

### :smiley: String sliding notation is straightforward

In guitar tablature, slides are typically notated using the symbols `/` for sliding up and `\` for sliding down between notes.

This notation shows a slide _up_ from the 5th fret to the 7th fret on the 6th string (picking only the 5th string note):

Same thing, rendered as simple text:

And here's notation for a slide _down_ from the 7th fret to the 5th fret on the 6th string:

<img width="682" height="254" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8fad5b9-d863-492b-a2ae-53ea6a9ad5a5" />


### :confused: String bending notation is a bit more complex...

There are different strategies for representing string bending on paper. One apprach is to write down the starting note (the note that's picked), then add the note that we're bend up to in brackets alongside:

<img width="556" height="251" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3ebeb0f-eba2-49d0-a051-ea9c2ec0ecc5" />

.. So above the tab instructs us to pick the note on the 3rd string of the 7th fret, then bend the note until the pitch matches the note on the 8th fret (same string). To describe this in musical notes, we're starting by picking a `D` note (7th fret, 3rd string, assuming standard tuning), then bending the string to elevate the pitch to a `D#` (the same note as playing 3rd string 8th fret). The above tab also includes the superscript **BU** label (_bend up_), but some tabs may not include this.


> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** The above bend represents a change in pitch of one semitone (`D` to `D#`, so it's a **semi tone bend**


Sometimes arrows are used to represent bending:

Reading left to right, once again we're starting by plucking the `D` note (7th fret, first string). The first bend represents a **full tone bend**, which would be `D` to `E` (jumping over the `D#` inbetween). The `full` label above the string bend tells us how much we're bending the string by. For the next bend (once again starting with the `D` on the 3rd string) we're only bending up a **semi tone** to `D#` (as indicated by the `1/2` label)

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** If we were representing the full tone bend using the previous notation method, it would look something like this: `----7----(9)`, as the 9th fret on the 3rd string is an `E` note


## Technique: bending (single string)

Trying to comprehensively teach string bending over text is a fool's errand. Check out this [very comprehensive string bending guide](https://youtu.be/fgDY8k0Gjzc?si=5eelEkprmmQxU9gS) from the excellent `JustinGuitar` YouTube channel.

## Technique: sliding (single string)

Pick a string and decide on a starting note. Fret the note, then pick the string so the note rings out clearly. Without lifting your finger, push or pull your finger up or down the neck to your target fret (for example, from the 5th fret to the 7th fret). Maintain finger pressure as you move, so the sound stays connected. Once you reach the target fret, let the note ring out.

Begin with short slides (like fret 5 â†’ fret 7). Once comfortable, try longer ones (like fret 3 â†’ fret 10) for a more dramatic effect.
