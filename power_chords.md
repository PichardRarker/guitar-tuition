# 💪 Power chords⚡

##❓ What are they? 

Power chords are simple, two-note chords often used in rock, punk, and metal music. They are easy to play and sound strong, even with distortion. 

Loads of very recongisable guitar riffs are written entirely with power chords, including:

- **"Smells Like Teen Spirit" – Nirvana**
- **"American Idiot" – Green Day**
- **"I Love Rock 'n' Roll" – Joan Jett**
- **"Iron Man" – Black Sabbath**
- **"Blitzkrieg Bop" – Ramones**
- **"Seven Nation Army" – The White Stripes** (main riff can be played with power chords)
- **"T.N.T." – AC/DC**



> 📌 **Note:** **Power chords are neither major nor minor**. They have an ambiguous sound because they lack the 3rd interval note
