# üí™ Power chords‚ö°

## ‚ùì What are they? 

Power chords are simple, two-note chords often used in rock, punk, and metal music. They are easy to play and sound strong, even with distortion. 

Loads of very recongisable guitar riffs are written entirely with power chords, including:

- **_Smells Like Teen Spirit_ ‚Äì Nirvana**
- **_American Idiot_ ‚Äì Green Day**
- **_All the Small Things_ ‚Äì Blink-182**
- **_Iron Man_ ‚Äì Black Sabbath**
- **_Blitzkrieg Bop_ ‚Äì Ramones**
- **_Seven Nation Army_ ‚Äì The White Stripes** (main riff can be played with power chords)

<br/><br/>


> üìå **Note:** **Power chords are neither major nor minor**. They have an ambiguous sound because they lack the 3rd interval note. This means i) They can be slotted into major and minor movements in songs, and ii) they sound good in rock and metal, where heavy distortion often muddies the sound of major and minor chords.

## :fried_egg: Power chord basic recipe

The basic elements of a power chord are:

- The root note (the low `E` string or the `A` string)
- The 5th interval (of a major scale), which is 2 frets over and 1 string down from the root note. 

![F5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6486478b-cad6-47e8-a674-b538a8647ebd)
<br/><br/>

For example, the image above shows an `F` power chord, where the index finger would play the 6th string on the first fret (which is an `F` note), and the middle finger plays the 5th string of the 3rd fret (which is a `C`). This chord is sometimes called `F5`.

> üí° **Tip:** 5th interval = 5 notes away. Starting from `F`, count five letter names up: `F` (1), `G` (2), `A` (3), `B` (4), `C` (5). This is why power chords are sometimes referred to as fifth chords.

<br/><br/>

Taking our `F5` chord as the starting point, moving the index and 3rd fingers each down by a string (but not changing the frets) gives us an `A#` power chord. The 1st finger is fretting `A#` (the root note) and the 3rd fretting `F` (which is 5 intervals away from `A#`)

## :cold_sweat: More involved: the 3 note approach

Some players use a slightly more complex strategy for playing power chords, playing 3 notes instead of 2. 

Returning to `F5`, we would (as before) fret 1st fret 6th string and 5th string 3rd fret. This time, we additionally add the little finger, playing 4th string 3rd fret:

**This is 3 notes, how can this still be a power chord?** Because this extra note is just another `F` (an octave higher on the `F` played on the 6th string). Even though 3 strings are being fretted, we are only playing `F` and `C` notes (multiple `F`s, x1 `C`), so it's still a power chord

As with the 2 string strategy, moving this shape down 1 string gives us an `A#` power chord, with 2 `A#`s and a single `F`

## :exploding_head: Even more involved: the barre chord approach

Yet another strategy for playing power chords involves _barring_ the fret containing the low root note, then placing 3rd and 4th fingers as described above.

> üí° **Tip:** _barring_ refers to a technique where you use one finger (usually the index finger) to press down multiple strings across a single fret. This creates a kind of "bar" across the fretboard, allowing you to play chords that would otherwise be difficult or impossible with standard finger placement. Chords which make use of this technique are referred to as _barre chords_

### Are power chords played this way barre chords?

Sort of. When you play a power chord using this approach, it's only technically a power chord if you hit the 6th, 5th and 4th strings. If you strum all 6 strings you'll find it makes a pleasant sound, but this is no longer a power chord - you're playing a minor chord using the barring technique. 

Let's look at `F5` again, played using the barring technique.

From the image above, it's easy to see that if we just hit strings 6, 5 and 4, then as with the 3 note power chord strategy, we're only playing `F`s and a `C` (`F5` power chord achieved!). If we additionally play strings 3, 2 and 1, then we add into the mix yet another `F` note (from the high `E` string, fretted at the first fret by the barre), another `C` note (2nd string 1st fret), **but also a `G#`, which comes from the barre on the 1st fret 3rd string. If you play `F`, `C` and `G#` together, you have an `Fminor` barre chord. 

This also means that, strictly speaking, you don't need to properly fret with your barring finger in order to play a power chord. You only need to accurately fret the 6th, 5th and 4th strings. If your barring is a bit off and the 1st, 2nd or 3rd strings are a bit muted, it doesn't matter (as you won't be hitting those strings anyway)
<br/><br/>

### :brain: Tips for barre chord approaches to power chords (and barre chords, in general)

The barring technique is particularly tricky for new players. You will need a bit of trial and error to find the hand position that works well for you, and will probably need a bit of finger sterengthening too (unles you're an avid rock climber). Some general tips are:

- **Press your thumb into the back of the neck for support**. This approach works well for most people. For other chord positions (e.g., open chords), your thumb doesn't need to be pressed into the neck
- **Rotate your index finger onto the side when barring**. This slight rolling pushes the boney part of your finger into the strings, making it easier to properly apply decent pressure to the strings
- **Rest your second finger against the barring finger**. You'll notice that none of the power chord strategies mentioned above use the 2nd finger. When playing barre chords, you can use the second finger to add more pressure to the barring.
- ***Experiment with different index finger heights**. When barring, move your index finger up (towards your head) or down (towads the floor). Your fingers are not uniform across their length - some positions will be easier for you to apply consistent pressure to the strings. Personally, I play barre chords with my tip of the index finger _very slightly_ higher than the 6th string.

## ‚ùì What power chord technique should I use when?

You might be wondering whether you need to bother learning all 3 power chord strategies (especially the barre chord approach, which most people find very difficult at first). As with many things on guitar, there's no objectively correct way to do it, and some people have personal preferences. [Some beginners even find the barre chord approach to be the easiest to master](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1812v5t/question_is_it_bad_form_to_barre_a_power_chord/?share_id=b5Jp5lzOc8P2wLNNxqAqz&utm_content=1&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1).

I would say that it's worth learning all 3 approaches, and learning when to deploy one over the other. Some points are provided below:

- The 2 and 3 string versions of the power chord are easiest to move around the neck at great speed. If you're playing fast metal, you probably want to use one of these approaches (check out a tab of _Iron Man_ by Black Sabbath. This would be hard to play with fret barring)
- The added `F` for the 3 note approach makes the chord sound a bit "fuller" when compared to the 2 string approach. If your guitar is drowning in distortion, you might not notice the difference. OWN OPINION, VALIDATE THIS
- The barre chord approach is a bit more forgiving to accidentally hitting strings outside the power chord. If you're playing a 3 note power chord with the root on the 6th string, then hitting strings 3, 2 and 1 probably won't sound good. If you're playing the 2 note power chord with the root on the fifth string, then hitting strings 6, 3, 2 or 1 probably won't sound good. Returning to our earlier `F5` chord example: if you're playing an `F5` chord by barring the first fret, and you get a bit carried a way and hit all 6 strings, strings 1 and 2 will sound good because they are within the power chord (`F` and `C` notes). It's only the `G#` on the 3rd string that causes issues, and only quite a minor issue, at that.
- You cannot fully escape the barring technique, you'll need it to play "proper" barre chords as you learn more songs. Might as well embrace it :)


Tip: an alternative strategy for dealing with accidental hitting of unwanted strings is to employ _string muting_: lightly placing a finger over unwanted strings, pre-emptively avoiding unwanted muddying of power chords by muting the sound these strings would make. This is particularly effective when playing power chords with roots on the 5th string - you can use your thumb, or the tip of your index finger to lightly press against the unwanted 6th string.
