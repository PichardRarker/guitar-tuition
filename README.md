# ðŸŽ¸ Guitar QuickStart Guide

## Introduction 

This short document aims to provide some useful beginner concepts for those starting out on their guitar playing journey. None of the information is particularly groundbreaking, and some important concepts are only touched on quite lightly. Itâ€™s intended to be a quick read that can be easily internalised, giving you the tools you need to start doing your own exploring (with or without my help ðŸ˜Š). I also provide a list of external (mostly free) teaching resources at the end. 

Happy playing!

**Which of these bits do I really need to know when starting out?**

* Tuning pegs: make sure to tune your guitar whenever you play. Just because you left it in tune, doesnâ€™t mean it will still be in tune when you next pick it up.
* Strings: these need changing every once in a while. When youâ€™re starting out, you donâ€™t need to change them that frequently (maybe once every 6 months, assuming you play regularly and donâ€™t accidentally break any of them). With more playing time, you might notice that old strings sound a bit dull compared to new ones.
* Pickup selector: experiment with moving the selector back and forth when playing. See if you can notice a difference. Typically the neck pickup (the one closest to the neck) sounds warmer and more bass-heavy, whereas the bridge pickup (closest one to the bridge) sounds bright and treble-heavy

## Musical notes

**The basics**

Musical notes are the building blocks of music. The standard musical notes are named using the first seven letters of the alphabet:

These notes repeat in a higher or lower pitch, known as octaves. In other words,  the note "A" can be found in multiple octaves on a guitar (and so can B, C, Dâ€¦).

**Sharps and flats**

In addition to the natural notes, there are sharps (â™¯) and flats (â™­):
â€¢	Sharp (â™¯): Raises the pitch of a note by a half step (e.g., Câ™¯ is a half step higher than C).
â€¢	Flat (â™­): Lowers the pitch of a note by a half step (e.g., Bâ™­ is a half step lower than B).
Sharps and flats overlap. A sharp (A#) and B flat (Bâ™­) are exactly the same note
B and E donâ€™t have sharps (or, equivalently, C and F donâ€™t have flats)
