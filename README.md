# 🎸 Guitar QuickStart Guide 🏃

## 👋 Introduction 

This short document aims to provide some useful beginner concepts for those starting out on their guitar playing journey. None of the information is particularly groundbreaking, and some important concepts are only touched on quite lightly. It’s intended to be a quick read that can be easily internalised, giving you the tools you need to start doing your own exploring (with or without my help 😊). I also provide a list of external (mostly free) teaching resources at the end. 

Happy playing!

### ❓ Which of these bits do I really need to know when starting out?

* `Tuning pegs`: make sure to tune your guitar whenever you play. Just because you left it in tune, doesn’t mean it will still be in tune when you next pick it up.
* `Strings`: these need changing every once in a while. When you’re starting out, you don’t need to change them that frequently (maybe once every 6 months, assuming you play regularly and don’t accidentally break any of them). With more playing time, you might notice that old strings sound a bit dull compared to new ones.
* `Pickup selector`: experiment with moving the selector back and forth when playing. See if you can notice a difference. Typically the neck pickup (the one closest to the neck) sounds warmer and more bass-heavy, whereas the bridge pickup (closest one to the bridge) sounds bright and treble-heavy.

## 🎵: Musical notes

### 🏗️: The basics

Musical notes are the building blocks of music. The standard musical notes are named using the first seven letters of the alphabet:

<br/><br/>
<img width="600" height="150" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81e040d7-2a9f-44c7-a4d6-0fe54810a01f" />
<br/><br/>
> 💡 **Tip:** These notes repeat in a higher or lower pitch, known as octaves. In other words,  the note `A` can be found in multiple octaves on a guitar (and so can `B`, `C`, `D`…).
<br/><br/>

### 🔪🥿 Sharps and flats

In addition to the natural notes, there are sharps (`♯`) and flats (`♭`):
* `Sharp` (`♯`): Raises the pitch of a note by a half step (e.g., `C♯` is a half step higher than `C`).
* `Flat` (`♭`): Lowers the pitch of a note by a half step (e.g., `B♭` is a half step lower than `B`).
<br/><br/>
> 💡 **Tip:** Sharps and flats overlap. `A sharp` (`A#`) and `B flat` (`B♭`) are exactly the same note.

> ❗ **Important:** `B` and `E` don’t have sharps (or, equivalently, `C` and `F` don’t have flats).
<br/><br/>
<img width="600" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01ced209-426b-4fd0-a307-e5715dcf1e68" />

> 📌 **Note:** **You don’t need to start memorising where the notes are when you’re first starting out!** Basic guitar playing can be done by learning hand patterns, rather than memorising notes. If you want to improvise lead guitar lines, it’s a different story…

<br/><br/>
## 🧶: Strings

The vast majority of guitar music uses a standard tuning pattern. The tuning of a string = the note it makes when you play the string without pressing down on any fret:

<img width="600" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f80dc3f-ba9d-426a-985c-f42395954673" />

<br/><br/>

> 💡 **Tip:** Mnemonic to remember strings in standard tuning:
>
>   - **E**very  
>   - **B**ulb  
>   - **G**oes  
>   - **D**im  
>   - **A**fter  
>   - **E**ight

<br/><br/>


> 📌 **Note:** perhaps counter-intuitively, the first string (a.k.a the high `E` string) is the one at the bottom of the guitar. In guitar tablature (see later on in this doc), the first string is depicted as being at the top of the diagram. Think of it as being first because it has the highest pitch.
<br/><br/>

Many non-standard tunings exist. These can be ignored when you’re starting out (unless you’re massively into metal and want to ignore every other genre).
<br/><br/>

## 🎸: Frets

Guitar frets are the metal strips embedded along the neck of the guitar. They divide the neck into fixed segments at intervals related to a musical framework. When you press a string down behind a fret, it shortens the vibrating length of the string, producing a specific pitch.

Each fret represents a half-step in the musical scale. For example, pressing down on the first fret of the low `E` string raises the pitch from `E` to `F` (`E#` doesn't exist), the second fret raises it to `F#`, and so on.

Every fret is made up of 2 fret markers, except for the first fret, which is made up of a fret marker and the nut (small strip of plastic or bone with grooves cut into it, holding the strings and separating the neck from the headstock (see earlier diagram).
<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>

> ❗ **Important:** **You absolutely don’t need to memorise the notes at this stage, this is purely scene-setting information**

> 📌 **Note:** Recall that the high `E` string is shown at the top of the diagram, even though it’s at the bottom of the guitar.

<br/><br/>
## 🎼: Chords

A chord is simply a group of notes played together, creating a harmonious sound.
On a keyboard, you would press down 3 notes to make a basic chord. On a guitar, you play 3 strings.

### 🎹: Below are the various notes that make up the chords within the C Major scale:


<img width="500" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff3bf687-3110-4800-a097-0267183962de" />

> ❓how do we know the chords that make up a scale? That comes later!

<br/><br/>
### 🙂☹️ Major and minor?

Each chord has a major and a minor variant. Put simply, major chords sound happy, and minor chords sound sad. If you see a chord written just like `C`, it typically means `C Major`. Minor chords are denoted like `Cm` or `Cminor`.
<br/><br/>
### 🎶: How many notes?

A chord has a minimum of 3 notes. If you play 2 nice-sounding notes together, you have a dyad (sometimes called a double-stop on guitar).

> 📌 **Note:** Some chords have more than 3 notes (e.g., `7th chords` and `9th chords`. These we will ignore for now).
<br/><br/>
### ❓: When I see people strumming chords, it looks like they’re playing more than 3 notes at a time…

Often a guitarist might be playing all 6 strings when strumming a chord, but they’re still only hitting 3 distinct notes. They will be hitting duplicate notes as they play. Take the `CMajor` chord for example, which is made up of `C`, `E` and `G` notes (see above). If you do the standard `C Major` open chord shape (described below) on guitar, then you’re playing:

* 6th string (low `E` string): `E` (open string)
* 5th string (`A` string): `C` (3rd fret)
* 4th string (`D` string): `E` (2nd fret)
* 3rd string (`G` string): `G` (open string)
* 2nd string (`B` string): `C` (1st fret)
* 1st string (high `E` string): `E` (open string)
<br/><br/>

## 🌐: Chord diagrams

Chords are often taught to guitarists using diagrams like this:

<img width="600" height="700" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2fecf590-820f-4edb-8a04-2ba3af6c1e98" />

> ❗ **Important points:**
>
> * The dark black line indicates the nut (the barrier between the first fret and the headstock).
> * The number within each dot = a suggestion of which finger to place on the string in question.
> * When presented with diagrams that show the guitar rotated 90 degrees (as above), the high `E` string = furthest on the right. If “right way up”, then these diagrams essentially mirror the guitar you’re holding, and so the high `E` string is at the bottom (so sometimes the high `E` string is at the top, and sometimes it’s at the bottom of the diagram. Confusing, I know).
> * In addition to the fretting instructions, the diagrams above show symbols next to the nut. `X` symbols indicate that the string should be muted or not played (string muting is a technique not covered in this doc). `0` symbols indicate strings should be played without any fretting (played open).

<br/><br/>
## 🗺️: Tablature


Guitar tablature ("tabs”) is a form of musical notation specifically designed for guitarists. Unlike traditional sheet music, which uses staff notation, tabs use a series of horizontal lines representing the guitar strings. Numbers on these lines indicate the frets where the player should place their fingers.
You can quite happily survive as a guitarist without ever learning proper musical notation (I can’t read sheet music, and have no intention on learning).
<br/><br/>
> 💡 **Tip:** Guitar tab is more flexible than chord diagrams – it can be used to represent chords, but also sequences of notes (riffs). 
<br/><br/>


### Example #1

<img width="250" height="170" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a51bb9d-963a-4bc6-bdbf-aba86b8ef7d2" />

This particular tab represents a single strum of an `E minor` chord, to `G Major`, to `D Major` and then to `C Major` (this happens to be the pattern for *Polly* by Nirvana).
<br/><br/>

> 🔑 **Key points:**
>
> * Numbers stacked vertically = played at the same time (forming dyads if 2 notes, or chords if 3+ notes).
> * Zero = “open” string (i.e., finger not pressing down on a fret).
> * As with chord diagrams, `X` symbols indicate that the string should be muted or not played.
> * Tab (typically) doesn’t give any indication of rhythm, timing, or technique. For that, you need your ears (or a decent YouTube tutorial).


### Example #2

<img width="350" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ec3a908-68c8-4cdf-9c9d-d86a5d935e57" />



This tab shows the opening riff of *Daytripper* by The Beatles. We’re now dealing with single notes, not chords.

## 🔊: Electric guitar amp effects

This is a very big topic, so we’re only going to cover the absolute basics here:
* `Playing "clean"` - a pure, undistorted sound often used in genres like jazz, pop, and certain styles of rock. 
* `Distortion` – a sound effect that makes your guitar tone grittier and more aggressive. It happens when the guitar signal is intentionally "clipped"—meaning the sound wave gets squashed and pushed beyond its normal limit. Distortion may be achieved through a dedicated switch on your amp, or through a `distortion pedal`, bought separately and added into your signal chain between the guitar and amplifier.
* `Bass`, `mids` and `treble`: the sound you make with an electric guitar is actually a mixture of different frequencies. Your amplifier will have dials that can selectively amplify the low frequencies (bass), high frequencies (treble) and those in the middle. Try playing round with different settings for these dials. A good starting point is setting everything to the 12 o’clock position. You can also find settings for your favourite songs online.

<br/><br/>
## 🛹: General tips/tricks when starting out

* The fingers on your fretting hand are going to really hurt at first. That’s normal. It gets better quite quickly, I promise. With a bit of exposure, your fingertips start to develop calluses (thickened skin). If the pain is really bothering you, consider putting some tape on the ends of your fingers.
* When first practicing chords, the hand positions are going to feel very alien. Your hand isn’t used to making those shapes. With a bit of practice, your hand will strengthen and get used to the sensation. 
* Having small hands isn’t going to be a massive hindrance! Pain/discomfort early on will pass as you strengthen your fingers. There’s plenty of great guitarists out there with small hands (check out the diminutive Eddie Van Halen, personal musical hero of mine).
* The key to practicing is: **nail whatever it is you’re playing at a slow speed, then gradually speed it up.** If you jump in too quickly with trying to play your favourite song at full speed, you’re going to ingrain mistakes into your playing. 
* If you’re learning how to play a track with distortion: try first playing it without distortion (or with minimal distortion). Many beginners hide their bad mistakes behind a big wall of fuzz (I know I did). There’s no hiding on the clean amp setting! On the flip side, playing with distortion is different to playing clean. If you only practice a song without distortion, chances are it’s not going to sound good when you finally switch to playing distorted. Learning strategies to “tame” a distorted guitar is essential to playing heavy rock and metal (but get the fundamentals nailed down first).
* Practicing without an amp for extended periods is not advised! Even if you’re playing clean,  amplification introduces subtle challenges to your playing, and you won’t experience these if you play unplugged. 
* Some people develop an irrational fear of strings snapping and whipping their arms/hands. You will eventually break a string, but there’s an incredibly miniscule chance it’s going to cause you any damage. In 20+ years a string has never caused me any damage.
* You don’t need to devote loads and loads of time to mastering the basics. One of the reasons guitars are so popular to learn is that you can start to sound good relatively quickly. Consistency is key – practice little and often, keeping up the momentum.

* [JustinGuitar](https://www.youtube.com/@justinguitar) (YouTube and personal website) – more beginner friendly lessons.
* [Ultimate-guitar.com](https://www.ultimate-guitar.com) – loads of free song tabs. Be careful to pick tabs which are highly voted – there’s loads of inaccurate tabs out there.
* [Filippo Dall’Asta’s “Learn how to improvise on guitar in 30 days”](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-how-to-improvise-on-guitar)  – this is a paid course for learning the basics of music theory as applied to guitar. I did this course during the COVID lockdown to brush up on theory, and found it really helpful.
* Google metronome – Google has an in-built metronome, if you want to practice playing in time (strongly recommend that you do this!).
* [Reverb.com](https://reverb.com/uk) – basically eBay for musicians. Great for picking up second-hand gear at a reduced price.

<br/><br/>
## ⚙️: Beginner's gear

* `Plectrum` (or pick) – small bit of plastic you use to hit the strings. Some guitarists just use their fingers, but it’s good to experiment with playing with a pick to see what you prefer. Picks come in a variety of thicknesses, to suit different styles and personal preferences. Just buy a variety pack to see what you like – they aren’t expensive.
* `Tuner`. Nowadays you can download a variety of free phone apps for tuning your guitar. These use the sounds your guitar makes to provide corrective feedback, and so are only accurate if played in a quiet space. A better way to tune is to use a device that actually connects to your guitar (using the same cable you’d use to connect your guitar to your amp). These can provide accurate results in any environment.
* `Capo` – a small plastic or metal clamp that effectively moves the guitar nut up the neck, creating a different tuning without touching your tuning pegs. Many popular songs require a capo to play them properly (you aren’t going to impress your friends with a rendition of *Wonderwall* without a capo on your second fret).
* If you live in London (and if you read this, you probably do), check out Denmark Street, otherwise known as Tin Pan Alley, near to Tottenham Court road. An entire street filled with music shops (mostly devoted to guitar). Great for inspiration and for sourcing cheap gear (or for dropping £30k on a 1950s Fender Stratocaster).

## 🏃: Next steps

There’s loads not covered in this doc, and many helpful beginner tips are not easy to convey on paper. For example, picking hand position, subtle positioning of the fretting hand fingers to avoid accidental muting of strings when playing chords, taming distortion, etc). Some of these concepts (e.g., hand position) don’t have a right or wrong answer, and it’s up to you to do some exploring and see what you prefer. It’s also good practice to pay close attention to how others play, especially if they play music you want to learn. Of course, these things can also be discussed in face-to-face lessons!
